# simple_exe
Just a simple .exe file created using the C language.

**-- HOW TO USE THE FILE**<br/>
The exe takes two arguments: the filename (to be created) and the text (to be written to the file).
On any windows machine, open command prompt and change the directory (cd) to where the downloaded file is.
Then, type the name of the file with the arguments specified above.<br/>
**NOTE: the text has to be written with double quotes surrounding it ex. "Hello World!".**<br/>
There will be a new .txt file (text file) located in the same directory in which the command was executed.
Click on the file and open it, wahla! The text has been written to the file.

**-- MY PURPOSE**<br/>
Though, this is a simple program (very very simple), this is my first time learning the C language. I have been trying to accomplish this for a long time which, is writing my own .exe file or using my file as a command without having to write the extension of my file. I've tried using Python but, there is no way to guarantee that it will actually work (especially when using pyinstaller) so, I chose a lower level / medium level programming language that will be able to give me (almost) full control over what it was that I wanted to do. Even though learning C is quite hard, it is also easy and teaches one more about the computer and what is actually going on when we are writting our programs. I RECOMMEND C TO ANY BEGINNER PROGRAMMER! Before actually moving on to a higher level language.<br/>
<br/>
If you have tried my program, Thank you! I'm looking forward to CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM and how I can become a better C programmer.
